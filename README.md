# Peek a Pass
Peek a Pass is a simple chrome extension that gives you the possibility to quickly see the password
that is currently in the password field (hidden by your browser by default).

From the version 1.1.0, you can also right click on the input field and directly copy the password
to your clipboard without showing it on the UI.
